
						hocr2djvuxml

This utility converts the hOCR files produced by CuneiForm
to the DjVu XML format.

The resulting XML files can be directly processed with djvuxmlparser
in order to insert the hOCR content into a DjVu-file.


This utility is quite basic yet. It recognizes currently only
the hOCR files produced by CuneiForm.

It also currently supports only the single-page hOCR files.

It is written on STL C++ and relies on the pugixml library.

It is the fully crossplatform utility.

Usage:

hocr2djvuxml [-char] <hOCR_path> <DjVuXML_path> [<DjVu_page_name>]

-char - output the CHARACTER-detalized OCR inforamation.
By default the program produces the WORD-detalized output.

<DjVu_page_name> - the internal name of a DjVu page in a multypage
DjVu file. This option is needed only for the multypage DjVu files.
